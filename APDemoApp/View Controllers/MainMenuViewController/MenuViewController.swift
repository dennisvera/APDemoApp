 *
 * 1) UI must work on iOS phones of multiple sizes. Do not worry about iPads.
 *
 * 2) Use Autolayout to make sure all UI works for each resolution
 *
 * 3) Use this starter project as a base and build upon it. It is ok to remove some of the
 *    provided code if necessary. It is ok to add any classes. This is your project now!
 *
 * 4) Read the additional instructions comments throughout the codebase, they will guide you.
 *
 * 5) Please take care of the bug(s) we left for you in the project as well. Happy hunting!
 *
 * Thank you and Good luck. - App Partner
